    One of the more difficult things of designing this API is the naming convention.
    
    In the documentation they refer to the "main" function as the "entry point" or "handler."

    This has me thinking I should go back to referring to these functions as "handlers".
    And then perhaps I can refer to the top-level handler as the "entry point".
